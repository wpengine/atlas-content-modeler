- Function insert_entry_model() for inserting a model entry and fields.

- Boolean fields in REST responses will now return `true` or `false` instead of `"on"` or `[empty string]`.
- Focus now moves to the new input field when adding a new repeating number, date or single line text field row.

## 0.16.0 - 2022-04-06
### Added

### Changed
- The first field now gains focus when creating a new ACM post.
- Telemetry is no longer sent for staging sites (those with  *.wpengine.com domains). Telemetry for other domains still requires opt-in, and is off by default.

## 0.15.0 - 2022-03-24
### Added
- Rich Text, Number and Media fields have a new “make repeatable” option. Enable it on new fields to let publishers add multiple rich text, number or image entries in one field.
- Repeatable text fields now include a “minimum” and “maximum” repeatable limit in advanced settings.
- Added a “Use Permalink Base” option on the edit model screen to set the WordPress `with_front` setting (true by default). Untick this to tell WordPress not to prefix your model entry URLs with custom prefixes from your WordPress permalink settings. For example, a site with a permalink structure of `/posts/%postname%/` will have post URLs of `/posts/your-acm-model-name/your-post/` by default. Edit your model and untick “Use Permalink Base” if you prefer a URL structure of `/your-acm-model-name/your-post/`.
- `wp acm blueprint export` now accepts a `--wp-options` flag to export a comma-separated list of WordPress options from the `wp_options` table. No options are exported by default. Example: `wp acm blueprint export --wp-options='blogname, permalink_structure`
- `wp acm blueprint import` now updates WordPress options if blueprints contain a `wp-options` key with a list of options values, keyed by option name.

### Changed
- The `wp acm blueprint export` and `wp acm blueprint import` commands now include all taxonomies for collected post types, including category and post_tag taxonomy terms for the WordPress core 'post' type.

### Fixed
- The delete model prompt no longer shows “undefined” in its title during model deletion.
- Improved checkbox styling in field settings.
- Options buttons now use the mouse pointer cursor.

- WordPress admin notices no longer overlay the Screen Options button on ACM entry pages.

## 0.14.0 - 2022-02-10

- New `wp acm blueprint export` WP-CLI command to export ACM data into a blueprint zip file. See `wp help acm blueprint export` for options.

### Fixed

- Opt-in anonymous usage tracking to help us make Atlas Content Modeler better (disabled by default).

### Changed
- The title field of a model can no longer be changed once set, unless you delete the original title field. This prepares upcoming work to save title field data to WordPress post titles, allowing title field content to be searchable.
